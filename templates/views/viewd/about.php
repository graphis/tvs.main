    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>
        After graduating from Michigan State University with a B.A. in psychology, I was drawn into the world of information technology and web development for its open, dynamic, and international community of progressive innovators&mdash;a community at the forefront of shaping the future of global society.
    </p>
    <p>
        I soon turned this passion into a part-time profession when my wife and I started up a business, Sloot Design. In addition to building websites for small businesses, we designed a line of greeting cards which I sold online and through a local art gallery. We also designed and hand screen printed t-shirts for local human-rights fundraisers.

        My studies at MSU focused heavily on data research and analysis, so&mdash;after two years of freelancing in graphic and web design, teaching myself HTML, CSS, and the basics of JavaScript and PHP&mdash;I secured a position as lead front-end developer at Redhead Design Studio, where I was able to offer a unique perspective in the development of user-friendly websites and content management systems.

        Under the tutelage of Redhead&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/jakejohns">web guru</a>, I worked hard to rapidly expand my knowledge of web development both front and back, application deployment and maintenance, and Linux server administration. Soon I was managing many of my own projects and working directly with clients and designers to pull together concepts and huge amounts of raw data into elegant web applications.

        After two years based in Redhead&rsquo;s studio in Lansing, MI, I spent a year working remotely from Chicago. With our web development director working remotely from New York, a seamless collaborative work-flow became essential and the move proved to be an indispensable learning experience.

        In November of 2016, my wife, Petra, and our dog, Nigel, packed up and moved to the Czech Republic to start something new closer to her family. During this transition period, I spend my time learning languages (Czech and Java), exploring new places, and learning to cook Czech cuisine with my mother-in-law. I am currently working on building a collaborative recipe website slated to go live in mid-2017.
