            A suite of interconnected content management systems with a parent
            and five &ldquo;unit&rdquo; sites, each hosted on a unique server
            and maintained by separate administrators. Alerts and special
            announcements can be shared across all sites via the parent.

            The Health4U CMS features a MailChimp integration. I combined
            their six existing mailing lists into one, with six sub-categories,
            reducing the cost of their MailChimp account and allowing for a
            simplified embedded signup form on their site which can introduce
            users to newsletters they may not have otherwise known existed.
            The MailChimp integration also includes an automated RSS campaign
            for the program&rsquo; monthly recipes.
