            This CMS was developed primarily to showcase CHAE&rsquo;s prolific
            faculty, fellows, and visiting scholars, as well as their many
            travel/study experiences for MSU faculty and graduate students.

            By special request, we tweaked the WYSIWYG editor to allow for
            social media embeds via URL, with oEmbed. I also built a custom
            drag-and-drop media gallery into the CMS that allows users to
            upload related images into one place, drag around to rearrange,
            and click to add captions or delete. These images then appear in a
            slider within a post.
