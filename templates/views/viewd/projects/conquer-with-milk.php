            Acting as a splash page for the United Dairy Industry of
            Michigan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Conquer with Milk&rdquo; campaign, this
            site was designed to showcase and complement the campaign&rsquo;s
            extensive Instagram feed, as well as provide some interesting
            facts and recipes about milk.
