            do1thing is a non-profit program that aims to educate the public
            on emergency preparedness. The site contains many resources, most
            of which are presented in multiple languages, with large print,
            visual, video, and audio resources for increased accessibility.
            With a multi-lingual audience in mind, we incorporated many icons
            and illustrations throughout the site&rsquo;s design.
