            The Michigan League of Conservation voters Great Michigan site
            aims to educate people about the environmental and conservation
            communityâ€™s top priorities for the state of Michigan legislature.
        </p>
        <p>
            We developed the site utilizing the Laravel PHP framework to create
            a CMS that allows administrators to create/edit/delete priority
            issues, priority actions, facts, and environmental groups and
            experts. Each group belongs to a particular area, either national,
            state-wide, or a specific region of Michigan. Each expert
            specializes in one or more priorities and belongs to a group.
